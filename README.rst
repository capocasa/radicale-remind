Radicale Remind Storage
=======================

Radicale storage backends providing a two way sync for Remind, Abook and
Taskwarrior. Remind files included from the main fail are exported as
individual iCal calendars, Taskwarrior projects as individual iCal todo lists.
Also see the limitations sections for `Remind
<https://github.com/jspricke/python-remind#known-limitations>`_ and
`Taskwarrior <https://github.com/jspricke/python-icstask#known-limitations>`_
for what can be converted.

::

  [server]
  hosts = 0.0.0.0:5232
  ssl = True
  certificate = /path/to/certificate.crt
  key = /path/to/privateKey.key
  
  [auth]
  type = htpasswd
  htpasswd_filename = /path/to/users
  htpasswd_encryption = sha1
